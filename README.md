**Title of Project:** ** Agri-Go **

**Team Members:**
1. Navya Rajvanshi
2. Mudita Shakya
3. Abhishree Bisht
4. Akanksha Tiwari

**Steps for Execution:**
1. Dataset Collection & Curation
Collected and labeled image datasets for various crops and plant diseases (e.g., tomato blight, rice leaf blast, etc.).

Created fertilizer recommendation dataset using crop type, soil data, and nutrient deficiency symptoms.

Ensured at least 10–20 high-quality images per class for initial model training.

2. Model Development
Trained three deep learning models using CNN-based architectures:

Crop Detection – MobileNetV2 for lightweight and fast classification.

Plant Disease Detection – EfficientNetV2 for high accuracy in disease identification.

Fertilizer Prediction – Trained a Decision Tree/ML model based on soil type, crop stage, and visible symptoms.

Evaluated models based on accuracy, F1-score, and inference latency.

3. Backend Development

Classify uploaded leaf/crop images.

Predict disease types and suggest cures.

Recommend fertilizers based on input features.

Endpoint-based architecture with switchable model logic.
